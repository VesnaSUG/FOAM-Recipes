# FOAM-Recipes
This repository contains a sample [FOAM][foam-intro] cooking recipe database application. However, the already generated application code is included only for reference. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The main purpose of this repository is for the user to follow the instructions in the [tutorial][tutorial] and create a FOAM application from *scratch*. 

If you are following along and starting from scratch the best way to start is with an empty github repository you own. You can find more information on how to create a new github repository [here][github-docs-repo]. 
Alternatively you can work with a local project that you can add remote tracking at later time. However, if you wish to just read along and have a running application you can clone this repository instead.

# Initial Setup

To follow along you need to have <code>Java</code>, <code>Node.js</code> and <code>Maven</code> installed in your environment. In most cases these are likely already setup. Should you need to install them, helpful tips can be found in the [FOAM installation instructions][foam-install]. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are following the [FOAM installation instructions][foam-install] note that you do NOT need to build FOAM in isolation for the tutorial. We will do this step when we add FOAM as a git sub-module to our project.

## Next Step

If you are building the application from *scratch*, the next step is to go to the [tutorial][tutorial] and follow the next steps there.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The instructions below are only for those who are skimming through the tutorial and do not wish to create an application from scratch.

If you only wish to run and explore the application, clone this repository, then:

```
TODO add the rest of instructions to run the app
```
